# Advanced Topics 

DSA practice as well as revisitng topics like 'this' 'bind' 'call' and various conceptual questions that could be common in interviews. 


## 🧐 Motivation & Challenges

> I'd like to feel better prepared for interviews and have a deeper understanding of dsa as well as software engineering as a whole. My approach is:
- Attempt the problem
- If failure or longer than estimated time to solve, try again in 2-3 weeks
- Repeat

> With conceptual questions:
- I'd like to attempt to answer the question in my own words
- Revisit the questions I'm lacking in understanding
- Repeat until I can answer the question confidently in my own words

## 🎯 Goal

- complete 5 dsa problems a week (sourced from leet code)

- complete 10 conceptual problems a week (sourced from various interview records)
