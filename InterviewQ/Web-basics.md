How the Web Works
What is JSON and why is it important?
* Could answer this more completely.
- JSON is a data format for storing data, as an object like string.
What do the following status code ranges represent: 200-level, 300-level, 400-level, 500-level
* Double check this
- 200 OK 300 User Error 400 Auth Error 500 Server Error
What's the difference between cookies and localStorage?
* Double check this
- Cookies and localStorage are similar in that they are ways to store data.
- Cookies are temporary, and are stored in a cache that is emptied when the browser window is closed.
- localStorage will persist until the user manually empties, and can hold more data.
Explain what a single page app is
- SPA is an application that appears on the "same" page even though the content may change.
Explain the same-origin policy with regards to JavaScript.
* Needs work
- SOP: all requests / responses must be from the same origin (IP)
What does idempotent mean?
- No side effects
Explain CSRF and how to protect against it
* Needs work
- request forgery, we protect our forms but I cannot remember how exactly?
What is an HTTP header?
- It is sent across the protocol and contains metadata about the contents.
What is an HTTP redirect? How does it work?
* Needs work
- A redirect will send a user to a new page instead of showing an error
- It works by sending a different response if a condition is met?
What happens when I type in google.com in the browser bar and press enter?
* Needs work
- google is matched with an address
- the web server then requests info from that address's server
- if successful there is a response
- the response is the webpage
- the web server receives the data needed to display the webpage and important items like cookies
- the webpage is complied and displayed
What is the difference between GET vs POST?
- GET requests information
- POST sends information
What is a web server?
* Needs work
- The server that contains the browser and displays web pages?
What are the parts of a URL?
* Fact check
- Port
- IP
- Hostname
- Protocol
